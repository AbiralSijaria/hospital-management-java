## Description-
    In this Project we aim to solve the traditional issues of hospital management. The existing system provided paper based solution for keeping OPD records of patients and hospital staff, but it gives overload to Doctor, Receptionist and Administrator.  The main issues were inappropriate data keeping, time wastage in storage, retrieval also patients were unable to understand the prescription etc. These issues are solved by providing a separate user account for doctors and other staff. Keeping each patientâ€™s data separate and track previous visits in a single click. 
    This project uses MYSQL as backend and is developed in Java so it provides features such as platform independence, high performance and security. It is a web application which mainly uses SpringMVC and Hibernate frameworks. 
    It provides some enhanced features such as: an easy interface to add, remove employees as well as it provides PDF of prescription. Thus, reducing need to manually write  and  sign  by doctor.
